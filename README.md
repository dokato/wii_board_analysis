# Wii Balance Board experiments analysis
Wii Balance Board data analysis using [OpenBCI](https://github.com/BrainTech/openbci) module for data aquisition and analysis support.

All analysis was done according to instructions from [this task](http://brain.fuw.edu.pl/edu/index.php/Nowe_technologie_w_fizyce_biomedycznej) (in polish only).

We calculate most common measures of postural steadiness:
- maximal sway
- mean COP
- RMS
- The 95% confidence ellipse area
- mean velocity
etc.

Three experiments were performed:

1) Quiet standing

2) Sway without feedback

3) Sway with feedback

Most of the work bases on Prieto TE, Myklebust JB, Hoffmann RG et al. (1996).
